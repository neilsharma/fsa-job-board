department: "Federal Student Aid"
location: "Remote"
salary: "GS-2210-15"

## Summary

Federal Student Aid (FSA) helps roughly twenty million people each year access more than $100 billion in federal student aid, and the FAFSA experience is the gateway to that entire system. Modernizing this ecosystem directly shapes educational opportunity for families across the country — the work you do here will have generational impact.

As a Principal Software Engineer, you'll take on nationally significant engineering challenges, bring product-driven development practices into a large mission space, and help set the technical pace for a high-output engineering team. This is a hands-on role where you will write code, guide architectural decisions, and improve how multiple teams build, test, deploy, and operate critical FAFSA systems.

**Recent engineering work on this team has included:**
- Modernizing core FAFSA application workflows used by millions of applicants, reducing friction for students and families nationwide.
- Shipping improvements that cut error rates in a major application step within a new engineer's first 90 days, directly increasing successful submissions.
- Rebuilding legacy components into modern, maintainable, testable services that reduce operational burden and lower long-term system risk.
- Improving performance, accessibility, and reliability across user-facing journeys so families can complete the form faster and with fewer barriers.
- Stabilizing backend systems that previously caused outages during peak application periods, improving uptime for millions of users.
- Enhancing CI/CD pipelines, testing infrastructure, observability, and deployment workflows, making teams faster and more predictable in shipping changes.
- Producing architectural roadmaps that clarified modernization priorities, enabling coordinated improvements across multiple contractor and internal teams.

## Duties

These describe the core responsibilities of the role — the work you will lead and deliver once you join the team. Duties focus on the outcomes and impact expected from this position.

- Design and build full stack software that powers the FAFSA experience and related student aid systems.
- Write production-quality code and review contributions from other engineers.
- Make architectural decisions that guide how key services, shared components, and interfaces evolve.
- Build accessible, performant, responsive interfaces aligned with federal accessibility standards.
- Improve engineering foundations such as testing, CI/CD, observability, code quality, and performance.
- Develop backend services and APIs that support rich, user-facing workflows.
- Plan and execute complex system or infrastructure upgrades while maintaining reliability.
- Collaborate with product, design, research, and policy partners to ensure technical decisions support real user needs.

## Specialized Experience

These describe the kinds of prior work that demonstrate readiness for a principal-level role. They reflect what successful candidates have already done — not what they will do here. This section is focused on past capability, depth, and judgment.

- Leading major technical efforts that span multiple systems or teams, including shaping technical direction and influencing how others build software.
- Writing and reviewing clean, maintainable, well-tested production code in modern languages and frameworks.
- Improving engineering foundations such as automation, CI/CD pipelines, observability, performance, and code quality.
- Planning and implementing significant system or infrastructure improvements — including database transitions, cloud deployments, performance enhancements, or reliability work — while keeping services stable.
- Applying product-driven engineering principles where technical choices are guided by user needs, measurable outcomes, and practical delivery constraints.
