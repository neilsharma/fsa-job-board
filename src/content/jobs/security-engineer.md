## About the Mission

Federal Student Aid (FSA) helps roughly twenty million people each year access more than $100 billion in federal student aid. The FAFSA experience is the gateway to that entire system. Modernizing this ecosystem directly shapes educational opportunity for families across the country — the work you do here will have generational impact.

## The Role

As a Principal Software Engineer, you'll take on nationally significant engineering challenges and help set the technical pace for a high-output engineering team. This is a hands-on role where you will write code, guide architectural decisions, and improve how multiple teams build, test, deploy, and operate critical FAFSA systems.

We're looking for engineers who have **at least ten years of experience building and operating critical, at-scale systems** — people who have seen what works and what doesn't when millions of users depend on your code.

**Recent engineering work on this team:**
- Modernizing core FAFSA application workflows used by millions of applicants, reducing friction for students and families nationwide
- Shipping improvements that cut error rates in a major application step within a new engineer's first 90 days, directly increasing successful submissions
- Rebuilding legacy components into modern, maintainable, testable services that reduce operational burden and lower long-term system risk
- Improving performance, accessibility, and reliability across user-facing journeys so families can complete the form faster and with fewer barriers
- Stabilizing backend systems that previously caused outages during peak application periods, improving uptime for millions of users

## What We're Looking For

You've led major technical efforts that span multiple systems or teams. You've shaped technical direction and influenced how others build software. You write clean, maintainable, well-tested production code and hold yourself and others to high standards.

You've planned and implemented significant system improvements — database transitions, cloud deployments, performance enhancements, or reliability work — while keeping services stable. You understand the tradeoffs between moving fast and building for the long term.

You apply product-driven engineering principles where technical choices are guided by user needs, measurable outcomes, and practical delivery constraints. You communicate complex ideas in plain language, enabling alignment between engineering, product, design, and policy partners.

Most importantly, you care deeply about the impact of your work. This isn't just another engineering job — it's a chance to improve access to education for millions of American families.

## What You'll Do

- Design and build full stack software that powers the FAFSA experience and related student aid systems
- Write production-quality code and review contributions from other engineers
- Make architectural decisions that guide how key services, shared components, and interfaces evolve
- Build accessible, performant, responsive interfaces aligned with federal accessibility standards
- Improve engineering foundations such as testing, CI/CD, observability, code quality, and performance
- Collaborate with product, design, research, and policy partners to ensure technical decisions support real user needs

## Compensation & Benefits

This is a GS-2210-15 position. Federal employment includes comprehensive health insurance, retirement benefits, and generous paid time off.

This position is **fully remote** — work from anywhere in the United States.
