## About the Mission

Federal Student Aid (FSA) helps roughly twenty million people each year access more than $100 billion in federal student aid. The FAFSA experience is the gateway to that entire system. Modernizing this ecosystem directly shapes educational opportunity for families across the country — the work you do here will have generational impact.

## The Role

As a Principal Software Engineer, you'll take on nationally significant engineering challenges and help set the technical pace for a high-output engineering team. This is a hands-on role where you will write code, guide architectural decisions, and improve how multiple teams build, test, deploy, and operate critical FAFSA systems.

## What We're Looking For

You have **10+ years building and operating critical, at-scale systems** and have led multi-year initiatives with measurable impact. You care deeply about the work — this is a chance to improve access to education for millions of American families.

New hires have recently accomplished in their first six months:
- Modernized core FAFSA workflows used by millions, reducing friction and support volumes
- Cut error rates in critical application steps, directly increasing successful submissions
- Rebuilt legacy components into maintainable services that reduce operational burden
- Stabilized systems that previously caused outages during peak periods, improving uptime for millions

## What You'll Do

You'll set technical direction while staying hands-on with code. You'll mentor senior engineers and shape how the team builds reliable systems at scale.

- Design architecture and write production code for systems serving millions of FAFSA applicants
- Set standards for code quality, testing, and technical reviews
- Mentor engineers and shape practices around performance, observability, and reliability
- Partner with product, design, and policy teams to align technical decisions with user needs
