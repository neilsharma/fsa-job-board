## About the Mission

Federal Student Aid (FSA) helps roughly twenty million people each year access more than $100 billion in federal student aid. The FAFSA experience is the gateway to that entire system. Modernizing this ecosystem directly shapes educational opportunity for families across the country — the work you do here will have generational impact.

## The Role

As a Principal Software Engineer, you'll take on nationally significant engineering challenges and help set the technical pace for a high-output engineering team. This is a hands-on role where you will write code, guide architectural decisions, and improve how multiple teams build, test, deploy, and operate critical FAFSA systems.

We're looking for engineers who have **at least ten years of experience building and operating critical, at-scale systems** — people who have seen what works and what doesn't when millions of users depend on your code.

**Recent engineering work on this team:**
- Modernized core FAFSA workflows used by millions of applicants, reducing multi-step friction and support volumes
- Cut error rates in a major application step within a new engineer's first 90 days, increasing successful submissions
- Rebuilt legacy components into maintainable services, reducing operational burden and long-term system risk
- Stabilized backend systems that previously caused outages during peak periods, improving uptime for millions of users

## What We're Looking For

You've led major technical efforts that span multiple systems or teams. You shape technical direction and set standards for other senior engineers. You care deeply about impact — this is a chance to improve access to education for millions of American families.

**What calibrates this role:**
- You've led multi-year or multi-system initiatives with measurable impact
- You're comfortable setting standards for other senior engineers
- You've implemented significant system improvements (database transitions, cloud deployments, performance work) while keeping services stable
- You communicate complex ideas in plain language across engineering, product, design, and policy teams
- You write clean, well-tested production code and hold yourself and others to high standards

## What You'll Do

- Design cross-cutting architecture that guides how services, shared components, and interfaces evolve across the FAFSA ecosystem
- Set and raise standards for code quality, testing practices, and technical reviews across multiple senior engineers
- Mentor senior engineers and shape team practices around performance, observability, and system reliability
- Write production-quality code for critical full stack features while maintaining hands-on technical leadership
- Build accessible, performant, responsive interfaces aligned with federal accessibility standards
- Collaborate with product, design, research, and policy partners to ensure technical decisions support real user needs

## Compensation & Benefits

This is a GS-2210-15 position. Federal employment includes comprehensive health insurance, retirement benefits, and generous paid time off. This role offers the opportunity to work on nationally visible, high-impact systems with long-term stability.

This position is **fully remote** — work from anywhere in the United States.
